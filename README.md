# Algorithms and Data Structures
**1. Greedy Algorithms**
   * Connecting ropes
   * Optimal merge patterns
   * Interval scheduling
   * Railway platform
   * Job sequencing
   * Knapsack
   * Rearrange string in such that same character is `d` distance far away.

**2. Dynamic Programming**
   * Longest common subsequence

**3. Data Structures**
   * Min heap
   * Max heap
