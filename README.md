# Algorithms and Data Structures
**1. Greedy Algorithms**
   * Connecting ropes
   * Optimal merge patterns
   * Interval scheduling
   * Railway platform
   * Job sequencing
   * Knapsack
   * Rearrange string in such that same character is `d` distance far away.

**2. Dynamic Programming**
   * Longest common subsequence
   * 0/1 knapsack
   * Subset sum

**3. Searching**
   * Linear search
   * Binary Search

**4. Sorting**
   * Insertion sort
   * Bubble sort
   * Merge sort
   * Quick sort

**5. Data Structures**
   * Min heap
   * Max heap
   * Stack
   * Queue

**6. Heap**
   * Find the k-largest elements
   * Find the k-sorted lists
   * Find the median in a stream of numbers
